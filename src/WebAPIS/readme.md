# 📝 Day 1 Coding Exercise – Product List with Tooltip & Infinite Scroll
# 🔹 Problem Statement

# You need to build a Product List component that:

# Shows a list of items (Product 1, Product 2, …).

# When the user hovers over a product, show a tooltip right under it with extra info.

# Use getBoundingClientRect to position the tooltip.

# Hide tooltip on mouse leave.

# Implement infinite scroll using IntersectionObserver.

# When the user scrolls to the bottom loader, fetch/add 10 more products.

# Add a Dark Mode toggle button using classList (CSS class toggle).


🔹 Expected Behaviors

Initially show 15 products.

On hover, tooltip appears (below item).

When scrolled to bottom, load 10 more products.

Dark mode toggles background & text colors.
